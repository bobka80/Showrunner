# Fragile Zones — Pre-Flight Checklist

**Read this before editing** any code in the zones below. For full technical detail, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

When the director reports a bug in these areas, state the risk in plain language before changing code (see [DIRECTOR_WORKFLOW.md](DIRECTOR_WORKFLOW.md)).

## Quick Reference

| Zone | Primary Files | Never Do | Safe Changes |
|------|---------------|----------|--------------|
| **Triangle of Truth** | `02b_Project_Syntax.html`, `02d_Equipment_Render.html` | Break bidirectional sync between human formula ↔ beautiful formula ↔ equipment list; rewrite slash parser casually | UI labels, non-parser display tweaks with testing |
| **Formula explosion** | `02e5_Logic_Sync.html` (canonical); **duplicates** in `02a_Project_Equipment.html`, `02_Project_Editor_Logistics.html` | Sum physical item qty on backend; edit one copy without checking others; disable `processFormulas()` without understanding | Bug fixes that preserve qty=1 burst rule for Physical types — sync all copies or consolidate |
| **Auto-Containerization** | `02e5_Logic_Sync.html` (`recalcAutoContainers`); called from `02e2`, `02e4`, `02e5` | Mix with bulk Auto-Packing; lock physical Case UIDs in planning UI | Fixes inside fluid kit logic only |
| **Auto-Packing (Bulk)** | `02e4_Logic_Containers.html` (`autoProvisionCableCases`); **called from** `02_Project_Editor_Logistics.html` | Touch predefined kits/fixtures; confuse with Auto-Containerization | Bulk cable/trunk logic in `02e4` only |
| **Matryoshka / nesting** | `02e4_Logic_Containers.html`, `Operations.js` | Store "children arrays" on containers in DB; hard-allocate unit IDs during planning | Respect bottom-up `containerUid` linking |
| **UID / optimistic healing** | `02e5_Logic_Sync.html`, backend save paths | Leave duplicate `uid`s on burst clones | Delete `uid` on clones when splitting items |
| **CLI regex** | `02b_Project_Syntax.html` | "Clean up" the unified regex | Leave parser alone unless fixing a documented bug |
| **processFormulas duplicates** | `02e5` (canonical), `02a`, `02_Project_Editor_Logistics` | Edit one copy only | Sync all copies or consolidate to single source |
| **Generalization / Blueprint** | `07c_Generalization_Engine.html` | Force `assetId` matching on blueprint `{ name, qty }` rows | Accept intentional ID stripping |
| **Index.html wiring** | `Index.html` | Add HTML module without `<?!= include ?>` | Every production module must be included before build |
| **Build pipeline** | `build.js`, root `.html`, `dist/` | Edit `dist/` manually; revert to inline `<?!= getFrontendLogic() ?>` | Edit source HTML → `node build.js` → `clasp push` |
| **RBAC boot payload** | `Main.js`, `Index.html`, `Security.js` | Inject raw JSON permissions into HTML without Base64 | Keep `userPermissionsB64` + `atob()` pattern |
| **Warehouse ledger** | `Operations.js` | Mutate assignments directly during RFID chaos | Append to `Operations_Ledger` |

## Triangle of Truth (Critical — Bidirectional)

The formula system has **three corners** that must stay in harmony:

1. **Human Written Formula** — Fast slash-based input (e.g. location segments separated by `/`). The operator types this in the CLI/search bar.
2. **Beautiful Formula** — Visual, human-readable representation of the same logic — for people who did not create the list or are reviewing it long after the fact.
3. **The List** — The actual equipment rows drawn from the Vault and assigned to the project.

**Bidirectional — not one-way:**

- **Formula → List:** When the human writes the slash formula the **first time**, the engine parses left-to-right and **draws equipment**, creating the list.
- **List → Formula:** The equipment list **also represents** the formula. Changes to the list must keep the beautiful formula and human formula consistent with what is actually assigned.

**Why "Triangle":** All three corners must agree. Breaking the parser, render loop, or list mutations severs the link — users can no longer trust what they typed, what they see, or what is in the database.

**AI rule:** Do not describe this as "the list reflects the formula" only. It is **mutual**. Never modify parser, renderer, or CRUD in one corner without verifying the other two still sync.

## Auto-Containerization vs Auto-Packing

Two **completely separate** engines. Never merge their logic.

| Engine | File / Function | Applies To |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| **Auto-Containerization** | `02e5_Logic_Sync.html` / `recalcAutoContainers()` | Physical fixtures in predefined cases (fluid kits) |
| **Auto-Packing** | `02e4_Logic_Containers.html` / `autoProvisionCableCases()` (triggered from logistics wizard) | `type: "Bulk"` loose gear (cables, tape) into trunks |

## Incident Log ("Break Locks")

When a bug is fixed, the director is unhappy, or a fragile rule is learned the hard way, capture it here so future AI sessions do not repeat it.

### How entries get added

1. Director reports bug / displeasure / suggestion (see [DIRECTOR_WORKFLOW.md](DIRECTOR_WORKFLOW.md))
2. AI fixes or discusses the issue
3. AI **asks:** *"Do you want me to add this to the Incident Log in FRAGILE_ZONES.md?"*
4. **Only if the director says yes** → AI appends one entry below

Never auto-write to this log without director approval.

### Entries

#### 2026-06-24 — Print Studio unwired (fixed)

```
DATE: 2026-06-24
SYMPTOM: PRINT button on Project Assets did nothing / console error openPrintModal is not defined
CAUSE: 02g_Project_Reports.html existed but was not included in Index.html build chain
FRAGILE ZONE: Build pipeline / Index.html wiring
FILES TOUCHED: Index.html (added include for 02g)
LESSON: Never document a module as live without verifying <?!= include(...) ?> in Index.html. After adding HTML modules, run node build.js and test PRINT.
```
