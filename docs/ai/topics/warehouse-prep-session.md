# Warehouse preparation session

**Entry:** [AI_DOCTRINE.md](../../../AI_DOCTRINE.md) · **Index:** [Project_TODO.md](../Project_TODO.md)

**Platform:** [session-fork-platform.md](session-fork-platform.md) — fork router, Firebase buffer, commit pattern.

**Related:** [project-assets-concurrency.md](project-assets-concurrency.md) · [logistics-warehouse.md](logistics-warehouse.md) · [EQUIPMENT_MODEL.md](../EQUIPMENT_MODEL.md)

**Status:** Partial — prep PA fork via DAL Phase 4 Slice B live; fuller floor UX still open. Auto-fork = multi-user **Part B**.

**Live sync:** Production / prep live rollback GAS **v654** + `host-boot.js?v=653`. **Floor scope (locked):** search/formula batch absolute adds primary; packing + RFID checkout parallel; floor +/- secondary — [../active/multi-user-fork-industrial-and-auto.md § Warehouse prep — real multi-user scope](../active/multi-user-fork-industrial-and-auto.md). Banner **`live sync (patch)`**. Tech: [../archive/dal-prep-live-sync-standards.md](../archive/dal-prep-live-sync-standards.md). Session banner: [FRAGILE § prep session UI](../FRAGILE_ZONES.md).

**Last swept:** 2026-07-19

**Dual-domain vs timeline:** **Resolved** (Slice D / GAS v603) — prep + timeline collab may both be open. Spec: [../archive/dal-phase4-slice-d-dual-domain-sessions.md](../archive/dal-phase4-slice-d-dual-domain-sessions.md).

**Post-campaign optional (do not build during DAL):** now **Part B** of [multi-user-fork-industrial-and-auto.md](../active/multi-user-fork-industrial-and-auto.md) (**after H0 testing + Part A harden**). Spec: [timeline-collab-session.md § Optional update](timeline-collab-session.md#optional-update--auto-fork-live-pull-in--idle-eject).

**Design lock note:** Logistics Hub / ledger = **atomic ops, not a prep fork** ([design lock §2](../archive/dal-firebase-design-lock-2026-07-13.md)). Older bullet below about ledger/hub on the Firebase fork is aspirational floor UX; router today keeps `LEDGER` on Sheets.

## Director intent

- **“Start preparation”** ≠ start packing only — includes **design mode** (add departments / lines).
- While prep is active: **project-wide mode** — everyone sees **IN PREPARATION**; rules differ (like timeline lock, but **shared** busy mode, not one editor).
- **No casual exit** — crew cannot turn off prep; only manager **End preparation** after checkout/check-in commit.
- **Fork right (PA):** Project Assets route to **Firebase** while prep open — **no direct Sheets** for PA until session closes. (Hub/ledger: see design lock — not forked via `Dal_Session_*`.)
- **Working vs selected department (shipped):** Design-mode **WORKING** picker (same slot as packing FILTER) stamps `overrideDept` on new adds. Click department **header** → green **PASTE** target (independent of WORKING). Expand/collapse = **arrow only**. Persist: `Project_Assets.override_dept` + live FS fixtures/sigs. Empty department folders stay hidden.
- **overrideDept refresh (shipped):** Live prep prefers state-doc fixtures over stale PA cache so dept moves survive browser refresh; load normalizes `override_dept`/`overrideDept`; schema inserts a real mid-sheet column (no append+relabel shift).
- **Twin General buckets (shipped):** Cut→green-dept paste that kept the same location/formula under two departments made DEL wipe both and live sync resurrect. **DEL / dept dropdown are department-bucket scoped**; cut→green-dept now renames location like copy (`General (1)` …).
- **Prep room board (shipped):** No top prep banner. Collapsed **SYNC** mini-header at bottom of vault (orange); click expands ~⅓ black body with roster + modes. Timeline: blue **SYNC** in crew column above Edit Crew; expand = names only.

## Expanded ledger (during prep)

Today `Operations_Ledger` is mostly checkout/check-in scans. During prep the ledger also records:

- [ ] Add asset to project list
- [ ] Pack / unpack / qty changes
- [ ] Checkout scans
- [ ] Truck placement (which truck, XYZ slot) — phased
- [ ] Check-in / recovery (symmetric session type later)

---

## Mode & UX

- [ ] Manager: **Start preparation** / **End preparation** (permission: manager+ TBD)
- [ ] Banner + lock styling on project editor, PA, logistics — `🔒 PREPARATION` / `IN PREPARATION`
- [ ] Opening project while prep active → auto-enter prep rules (no bypass to slow Sheets path)
- [x] Roster: who is in prep room — vault orange panel (presence + PA mode); names + Editing/Packing/Check-out|in
- [ ] Richer action feed (what they changed) — deferred; mode-only for now
- [ ] Activity feed: visible actions (who scanned, added, packed)
- [ ] FCM: prep started / ending / committed

---

## Fork coverage (coding level)

| Slice | During prep | Commit target |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Project Assets rows | Firebase | `Project_Assets` sheet |
| Operations ledger events | Firebase | `Operations_Ledger` |
| Checkout session state | Firebase | `Projects_Index` + ledger |
| Truck arrangement | Firebase (phased) | truck/load tables + PA refs |
| Logistics hub (auto-pack / arrange) | Firebase-backed UI (phased) | PA + containers per EQUIPMENT_MODEL |

**Not on fork:** timeline, global tasks, crew roster, vault master data, financials.

---

## Code touchpoints (planned)

- [ ] PA router — new module or `02e*` integration; mobile `01h` follows same router when prep active
- [ ] `02c_Project_Operations.html` — checkout during prep
- [ ] `05a_Truck_Arrangement.html` — truck placement on fork
- [ ] Logistics hub / auto-pack UI — **do not** merge `02e4` auto-pack with `02e5` auto-containerization
- [ ] `Operations.js` — session open snapshot, commit, finalize
- [ ] `Security.js` — who may start/end prep

---

## Phased delivery

### Phase A — Session shell + PA + ledger on fork
- [ ] Start/end prep API
- [ ] Snapshot PA + ledger → Firebase
- [ ] Design add, pack, checkout on fork
- [ ] Commit on **End preparation** (after checkout complete — director rule)

### Phase B — Check-in / recovery symmetry
- [ ] Session type `recovery` / check-in direction
- [ ] Same fork, reverse ledger semantics

### Phase C — Truck placement
- [ ] Manual XYZ / which-truck on fork
- [ ] Live sync for loaders + gate

### Phase D — Logistics hub fast path
- [ ] Replace slow project-editor logistics hub during prep
- [ ] Auto-arrange: batch on fork or GAS job writing results to Firebase (compute strategy TBD — Firebase does not speed GAS CPU)

## Supersedes (partial)

Floor-mode multi-user items in [project-assets-concurrency.md](project-assets-concurrency.md) move here when prep session ships. Keep concurrency doc for **normal-day** Sheets improvements (collision, mobile auto-save) until prep covers floor.

---

## Firebase read budget (prep-heavy day)

Assume 5–8 people, 150 PA rows, 500 scans — **stay lean** per [session-fork-platform.md](session-fork-platform.md). Heavy naive listeners can exceed Spark 50k reads/day.
